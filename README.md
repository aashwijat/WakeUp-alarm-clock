ALARM CLOCK PROJECT

Made with Python and Tkinter using modules - datetime, time, playsound and threading.
This alarm clock provides users with the basic functionality of setting an alarm and stopping it on play.

As a beginner, I thought it would be best for me to start small with basic projects that still manage to challenge me.
Working on this project taught me the functionalities of modules I had not used before and different ways to approach the same project.
